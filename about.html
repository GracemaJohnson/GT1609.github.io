    <h1> To My Dearest One,</h1>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">"If i know what love is,it is because of you."
        <br>
        Everyday that passes,i feel that i love you more.I feel thankful for the times we spend together.Actually i enjoy it so much.
        Because you make me the happiest person in the world! You make me feel like i'm the luckiest girl in the world,
        Everyone says this, but i don't know whether they mean it or not.But honestly i swear i mean it.Because i got a CUTE little boy.
        He is not only cute,he is caring,loving,annoying,irrittating,smart,handsome,hot and he is my cute snowbell.
        And he is my first baby.A name can make you smile,blush,emotional,weak,happy.Yes,life is all about that one name,one 
        priceless person,infinte memories.
        You know who it is? It's you my baby.I enjoy each moments i spend with you. And i will start missing you
         the second you left me,i don't know why.Even your name make me happy.I know and feel that you are my perfect
        companion and my best friend.
        <br><br>
        When i first met you,i had no idea i was gonna get this attached.But you're my favourite person from the day we met till today.
        As the days went by,I could feel myself slowly falling in love with you.I think about you all the time from the moment i wake up 
        to the moment i fall asleep,even in dreams.When i think about you,i realize that you are the one that holds the key to my heart.
        I know for a fact we are meant for each other.Seeing your smile literally changes my whole day.
        Just know i will never let go of you and my feelings will never disappear.That's my promise to you my love.
        There's always been alot i have been through with you laughs,cries,sadness,anger still i never felt that you leave me
        because i know i can trust you the most.I know you won't leave me easily,we can't live without each other's presence,i'm glad
        i met you,maybe alittle late but atleast i have you in my life.You're my favourite person and i always want to be your favourite
        person too.You are the only one who i wouldn't mind losing sleep for,the only one who i can never get tired of talking to
        and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day.You are the only one who can make me smile without any 
        intention and affect my emotions with every action of yours.I can't explain in words how much you mean to me 
        but you're the one i'm afraid of losing and the one i want to keep in my life.
        <br><br>
        I love to see you being so happy,morely when i'm the reason for your happiness.I believe that i'm making you happy.
        I hope that you will be more happy and your sad emotions will turn into a happy emotion when you see me.<br>
        I love it when you are happy in teasing me,annoying me,irrittating me and by angryfying me.It will annoy me sometimes
        but i really enjoy it.And i really enjoy it when you patiently listen to my pottatharam without any hesitation 
        eventhough u didn't understand it.I really don't understand that why you like my oola song this much and you wanting me to 
        practice and sing it for you.I feel horrible when i hear my song.Whatever i'll try my level best to make 
        my song to be nice.Anyway you have no option other than to say that it is nice nice and encourage me eventhough 
        it's not that much good.When you irritate me,i hate it a lot.But when you stop irritating me,i hate it even more.
        <br><br>
        Nextly,i want to say that,I really don't care about what others think or speak or how they see us.I love the way we are.
        I like how we are natural,not over dramantic,but over romantic and the way we love each other,care each other,encourage
        each other,motivate each other etc..Especially when you motivate me,you always support me even i have no plan
        or motivation.You are the reason for who i'm now. And you are the reason i'm doing this one.
        I want to achieve good things not for me(i do) but for you,your efforts 
        to make me and teach me something valuable.You have a lot of things to do but you are spending your valuable time for me.I promise
        you to make you feel so proud of me and to say that's my girl.
        <br><br>
        You know,i never doubted or regretted about my decision of choosing you.I'm confident in my decision.
        Because you are more than enough for me.
        Sometimes i feel like do i really deserve him?(Don't try to be perfect for me.you are already more than i deserve.) 
        Because you are really so good.Why you are so good! I'm so proud
        to introduce you as my boyfriend or to say yaa that's my boy.I'm so confident to introduce you to my parents,Actually
        i'm waiting for that moment.I'm damn sure that they will like you, love you,ofcourse they will adore you.
        And i'm eagerly waiting for the moment that both our parents says yes to our love.<br>
        I don't know that i have the capability or not to treat you or love you as like your mummy but i'll make sure to care you well in 
        my own style and with my true love.
        <br><br>
        I fell in love with YOU but what i actually mean with "you" is.....<br>
        The person you are,didn't just fall in love with how you look or your body,I fell in love with your voice,
        your laugh and the way you treat me.

        <br><br>
        I really wanted to say something to you that, don't hide when you are in pain.Because that's the only thing which makes me sadder.
        It's not a right thing,we laugh together,we share our happiness but not your sorrows!you think like what the need of sharing your 
        pain or knowing your pain because you think that makes me sad.Yaa yes it makes but it's ok.i won't allow you to suffer alone in 
        any situation,no matter what happens.I want to comfort you,pamper you.I want to wipe your tears and to give my shoulders
        for you to rest and tap your head until you forget your sorrows.I really want to be with you in such a situation and motivate 
        you,boost you and i want to do everything that i can to make you happy happy.I really want it baby.So please allow me to do that. 
        <br><br>
        I wish that you could feel my arms about you tight,holding you up close all thru the night.<br>
        To know that I am there and never away far,and that I will remain where ever that you are.<br>
        That you could press back into my warm embrace,and feel my soft touch warm against your face.<br>
        Or you could shift your hips and press against me tight,to feel my body's heat and my lips kissing you light.<br>
        I wish that you could hear my softly whispered song,to lull you into sleep for it's here that we belong.<br>
        That you could hear me say all you need to hear,as i tell you of my love whispered soft against your ear.<br>
        And you could feel my breath warm against your skin,as i let my presence beg you to let this true love in.<br>
        i wish that i could hold you and whisper long into your night,never would you wounder then as i held you to me tight....
        <br><br>
        I'll pick you up when you're down.when no one is around,i'll be there.Everything about this is surreal.I know you're the one,
        because in my heart i've never been happier or felt more complete ever,to love you is something that comes most naturally
        and effortlessly to me, so i know in the bottom of my heart that our love is something that is pure and true and after all 
        the times i know that i was meant to be with you.I will not leave you no matter what.I want to travel by your side...
        so love me my love you're all that i 
        need in my life to make me feel complete and happy again.<br>
        And i'd choose you again...<br>
        And again...<br>
        And again...!   
        <br><br>
        And it's our first valentines day.It's so special to me.Previous year we don't speak that much but look how we are now....<br>
        When i think about this i don't know it's making me emotional.What will i do if we didn't meet?Anyways now i'm with you
        that's enough for me.<br>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: maroon; font-size: xx-large;">HAPPY VALENTINES DAY MY LOVE</p>
