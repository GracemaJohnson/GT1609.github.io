        You always ask me why i love you so much? And you thought you was same as others.<br>
        I going to answer for this.You are not same as others.I mean, you are something special.For others vision you are special 
        in the way you talk,the way you behave,the way you respect others,the way you care for others,the way you treat others etc..
        But i have a lot of reasons more than this, And i want the reasons be only known by me, i don't want anyone to discover 
        that reasons.Because i don't want anyone to look at you the same way i look at you.
